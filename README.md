Prescriptive Analytics Project:Optimizing cross-border network flows across 27 countries for DHL Parcel Connect Deutsche Post DHL Group | February 2019

Context:
Deutsche Post DHL Group is the world’s leading logistics company. The Group connects
people and markets and is an enabler of global trade. It aspires to be the first choice for
customers, employees and investors worldwide. DHL eCommerce Solutions provides
domestic and international parcel services for business customers and consumers, as well
as individual services and tailored solutions for e-commerce customers.

Task:
With the “DHL Parcel Connect”, product, DHL eCommerce Solutions offers retailers an
attractive way to server customers throughout Europe (currently: 27 countries).
With fast transit times (usually 1-3 days) and low cost among its unique selling points,
designing the logistics backbone behind this continent-wide operation is essential.
Shipments are being routed through a network of existing cross-docking locations where
they can be re-distributed to trucks to achieve better truck utilization while keeping cost and
transit times low.

Your task is to optimize this network to make it ready for continued volume growth!
